Loaded `r format(object.size(ratings), units="Mb")` of ratings data, containing `r format(nrow(ratings), big.mark = ",")` ratings. Here's a preview:

# Anatomy of the long tail

```{r long-tail}
# generate the equivalent of figure 2a of this paper:
# note: don't worry about the "null model" lines
# just do the solid lines and dotted line (optional)
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).

# filter the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies

ratings_by_user_atleast10 <- ratings_by_user %>%
  filter(count >= 10)

# create a dataframe of just the userID-rank-movieID columns

ratings_10 <- left_join(ratings_by_user_atleast10, ratings, by="user_id")

ratings_10 <- left_join(ratings_10, ratings_by_movie, by = "movie_id")

rank_user_movie <- ratings_10 %>%
  transmute(user_id, movie_id, rank)

# group by the userID and calculate at which level (rank) the user will be 100% satisfied [i.e. the highest rank, meaning the lowest popularity level] 
# and at which level (rank) the user will be 90% satisfied [i.e. the rank that is at the 90th percentile of the users movie ranks]

user_satisfaction <- rank_user_movie %>%
  group_by(user_id) %>%
  summarize(satisfied_100 = max(rank), satisfied_90 = quantile(rank, 0.9)) %>%
  arrange(desc(satisfied_100))

# now we want to group by the rank level at which the users will be satisfied 100%
# then count those levels
# finally, we want a column that will calculate the percent as which a user is satisfied 100% -->
# for each satisfaction_100 level: [users who are satisfied UP UNTIL that sat_100 amount (cumsum)] / [total amount of users(sum)]
